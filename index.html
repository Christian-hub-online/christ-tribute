        <p class="head">HISTORY OF THE SAVIOUR</p>
        <p class="info">The world has never seen a worker like Jesus, never seen a vessel connected with God the Father every moment of every day and night. Jesus received all from the Father and poured out all to mankind, even His very life. We hear Him say in John, I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work (John 9:4). The night came for Jesus, which meant He would have to work through others.</p>
        <p class="info">Although born in Bethlehem, according to Matthew and Luke, Jesus was a Galilean from Nazareth, a village near Sepphoris, one of the two major cities of Galilee (Tiberias was the other). He was born to Joseph and Mary sometime between 6 BCE and shortly before the death of Herod the Great (Matthew 2; Luke 1:5) in 4 BCE. According to Matthew and Luke, however, Joseph was only legally his father. They report that Mary was a virgin when Jesus was conceived and that she “was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit” (Matthew 1:18; cf. Luke 1:35). Joseph is said to have been a carpenter (Matthew 13:55)—that is, a craftsman who worked with his hands—and, according to Mark 6:3, Jesus also became a carpenter.</p>
        <p class="info">Luke (2:41–52) states that Jesus as a youth was precociously learned, but there is no other evidence of his childhood or early life. As a young adult, he went to be baptized by the prophet John the Baptist and shortly thereafter became an itinerant preacher and healer (Mark 1:2–28). In his mid-30s Jesus had a short public career, lasting perhaps less than one year, during which he attracted considerable attention. Sometime between 29 and 33 CE—possibly 30 CE—he went to observe Passover in Jerusalem, where his entrance, according to the Gospels, was triumphant and infused with eschatological significance. While there he was arrested, tried, and executed. His disciples became convinced that he rose from the dead and appeared to them. They converted others to belief in him, which eventually led to a new religion, Christianity.</p>
        <p class="info">Jesus came for everyone. Thus I invite you to <a href="https://www.biblica.com/bible/niv/matthew/1/" id="tribute-link" target="_blank" >learn more</a> about your saviour.
